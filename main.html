          <h1>Land Resources</h1>
          <p>Land resources encompass various types of terrain, including agricultural land for farming, forested areas for biodiversity and wood products, urban spaces for human settlements and infrastructure, rural zones supporting agriculture and small communities, protected areas for conservation, water bodies, deserts, and wastelands. These resources are vital for sustaining ecosystems, providing habitats, supporting economies, and fulfilling human needs. Managing land resources responsibly is crucial for ensuring environmental sustainability, biodiversity conservation, and the well-being of present and future generations.</p>

          <h3><a class=land href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overgrazing">Overgrazing</a></h3>
          <p>Allowing livestock to graze excessively on land can lead to the degradation of vegetation, soil compaction, and erosion. It disrupts the natural balance and can result in the conversion of productive land into wasteland.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card">
          <img src="Agriculture practices.jpg" alt="img">
          <h3><a class=land href="http://www.globalplanofaction.org/unsustainable.html">Agricultural Practices</a></h3>
          <p> Unsustainable agricultural methods, such as monoculture, excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and poor irrigation practices, can degrade soil quality, reduce fertility, and lead to erosion.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card">
          <img src="Deforestation.jpg" alt="img">
          <h3><a class=land href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation">Deforestation</a></h3>
          <p>Clearing large areas of forests for agriculture, logging, or urban development removes the protective cover of vegetation, leading to increased soil erosion and loss of soil fertility.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card">
          <img src="urbanisation.jpg" alt="img">
          <h3><a class=land href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization">Urbanization</a></h3>
          <p>The expansion of cities and infrastructure often involves the conversion of agricultural or natural land into impervious surfaces like roads and buildings, disrupting ecosystems and contributing to soil sealing.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card">
          <img src="Mining.jpg" alt="img">
          <h3><a class=land href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining">Mining Activities</a></h3>
          <p> Extractive industries, such as mining and quarrying, can lead to the disturbance of land, soil erosion, and the release of harmful chemicals into the environment, impacting both the surface and groundwater quality.</p>
